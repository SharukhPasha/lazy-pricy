## Lazy Pricy

A data-scraping project that collects data from [manarythubazaar](https://manarythubazaar.com). The data is only about the daily prices of vegetables.

Developed using Django and hosted on heroku.

I have absolutely no rights over the data. Manarythubazaar is the sole owner of the data.
