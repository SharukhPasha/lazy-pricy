## Lazy Pricy

A data-scraping project that collects data from [manarythubazaar](https://manarythubazaar.com). The data is only about the daily prices of vegetables.

### Motivation

Inorder to actually see the prices in the original site, the user has to select the city and area/locality in two different pages. I reduced that to one in my site. Instead to two different pages, you have two dropdowns for them and once you submit them, voila!

### Developed using

1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
2. [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
3. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

***Disclaimer**: I have absolutely no rights over the data. [manarythubazaar](https://manarythubazaar.com) is the sole owner of the data.*
